## ❓ Why Next.js Instead of Plain React?

- **React** is a UI library — it only builds interfaces.  
- **Next.js** is a full framework — it includes:
  - File-based routing
  - Multiple rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, CSR)
  - Built-in backend support using API routes
  - Better performance and SEO

This project leverages **Next.js App Router** to handle both frontend and backend in a single system.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add email notifications using **Nodemailer**
- Integrate form validation with **Zod**
- Add **Admin Panel** to view messages
- Deploy using **Vercel** or other cloud services
